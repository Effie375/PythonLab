Repo is implemented in two main stages. In the first stage, basic ones are analyzed algorithmic techniques in the **C programming language**, such as:

- its syntax language (variables, constants, expressions, basic data types, sentences,

- data entry / output,
- flow control commands iterations,
- tables,
